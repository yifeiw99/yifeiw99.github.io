Abstract: 
Numerous experts believe that deep fakes can be a weaponized form of falsified content because they are often indistinguishable from reality. Although the literature on public engagement with deepfakes is continually growing, most investigations focus on Western democratic contexts where social media penetration and levels of general digital literacy are high. If and how would deepfakes evoke news skepticism and discredit social trust in Asian societies with low levels of digital literacy are nearly absent. Recognizing the gap in the literature, this study conducts a survey experiment in India. We test whether individuals adjust their perceptions of news accuracy after being exposed to a non-political deepfake. Furthermore, we examine if cognitive ability will play a critical role in distinguishing how participants readjust their perceptions of news accuracy. In line with the propositions, we find that those exposed to a malicious deepfake video are more likely to lower their initial higher news accuracy perceptions than those exposed to an informational video. We also observe that the adjustments of news accuracy perceptions after being exposed to a deepfake are not dependent on the cognitive ability of social media news users. Finally, we discuss the theoretical and practical implications of our work.
