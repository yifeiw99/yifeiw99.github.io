Abstract: 
Given the escalating partisan polarization in most political discourse, selective avoidance
behavior goes beyond personal arenas and can severely affect social integration and consensus building. While existing literature on selective avoidance focuses on motivated reasoning and confirmation bias, this study explores how specific social media behaviors and cognitive ability can trigger selective avoidance. In a digital age featuring information overload, context collapse, and data economy, we investigated the roles of expressive social media news use, political discussion with weak ties, surveillance anxiety, and cognitive ability in influencing social media usersâ€™ selective avoidance behaviors. We use online panel survey data collected during the 2020 US Presidential election to test our assumptions. The findings suggest that those with high levels of expressive social media news use, political discussions with weak ties, and surveillance anxiety engage in more frequent selective avoidance. On the contrary, those with high cognitive ability are less likely to engage in selective avoidance. Furthermore, moderation effects suggest that the low cognitive users with greater surveillance anxiety and frequent discussions with weak ties are most accustomed to selective avoidance. We further discuss the theoretical and policy implications of these findings.
