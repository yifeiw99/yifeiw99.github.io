* Abstract: 
The 2020 US election witnessed a surge of false claims on social media platforms asserting electoral fraud. It is, therefore, possible that voters who engaged with online misinformation wouldâ€™ve been more skeptical of the electoral process. Consequently, we asked the question, would greater online political engagement prompt mistrust in electoral integrity among citizens? This study used a two-wave panel design to survey a nationally representative sample of US voters to examine whether and how online political participation eroded trust in electoral integrity. We also explore whether the effects of online political participation on electoral integrity are contingent upon partisanship and the news literacy of citizens. First, the findings suggest that those who engaged in greater online political engagement were more likely to mistrust electoral integrity. Next, Republicans and those with lower levels of news literacy were also less likely to trust the electoral process. Further, moderation analyses suggest that the adverse effects of online political participation on mistrust in electoral integrity were more significant for Democrats and Independents than Republicans (perhaps because of ceiling effects). Finally, the relationship between online political participation and evaluations of electoral integrity is not contingent upon news literacy. Practically, the results highlight the dark consequences of online political participation in how it can erode electoral trust. Theoretically, the study goes beyond the frequent partisanship- driven explanations of variances in electoral integrity. It introduces the impact of online political participation and news literacy in explaining citizen evaluations of electoral integrity.
